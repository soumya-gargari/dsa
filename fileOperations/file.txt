In the example above we read the file chunk by chunk, specifying which is the buffer size we want to read each time.
Only len(buf) is allocated in memory and read at each iteration. This is specifically ideal for large files,
where content cannot fit entirely into memory. Notice how we break the loop once we receive an io.EOF error,
which defines the end of the file.
HTTP 1.1 did not have built-in support for header compression, so headers were sent in plain text, which meant that they took up a 
significant amount of bandwidth. As a result, while sending large numbers of headers or when sending headers over slow connections,
 problems were faced.

These are the major reasons why HTTP 1.1 was replaced. However, there are other differences between the two versions. So first,
let us compare both of them.
